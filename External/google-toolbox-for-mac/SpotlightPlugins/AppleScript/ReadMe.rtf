-----------------------\
\
This is a spotlight importer for AppleScripts.\
It imports the description and the code of an AppleScript to make them easily searchable.\
\
To install the spotlight plugin, please copy it into /Applications/AppleScript/Script Editor/Contents/Library/Spotlight.\
\
If you are wondering why we just don't copy this one into /Library/Spotlight or ~/Library/Spotlight it is due to the fact that on 10.5 the UTIs declared by Spotlight importers don't seem to be recognized unless they are in an application's /Library/Spotlight directory. There isn't a UTI for AppleScript bundle files (.scptd) so we declare one in the importer. If the importer isn't located in an application's /Library/Spotlight directory, you won't be able to import .scptd files.\
\
Radars logged:\
6160646 UTIs declared in Spotlight Importers in Library/Spotlight not recognized\
6160685 Need UTI for AppleScript script bundle\
6160707 UTCoreTypes.h needs to be updated\
